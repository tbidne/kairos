# Revision history for kairos-core

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to the
[Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

For those unfamiliar with PVP, it is essentially
[SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), except the PVP major version is
the first _two_ components (e.g. `0.9` in `0.9.1`), and PVP has no exception
for versions < 1.
